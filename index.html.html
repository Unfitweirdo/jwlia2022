        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <section class="history">
        <p>
            The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three
            visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and
            Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the
            Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on experience and
            training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and
            leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an
            Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of
            social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make
            a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this
            program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in
            Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.
        </p>
                <p>The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based
nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons
College School of Management's Center for Gender in Organizations.</p>

        <p class="artP">In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. - Japan Foundation,
JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012
and 2013, these public forums provided information about the nonprofit sector
and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take
leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.</p>

            <span><strong>Atsuko Toko Fish - Founder</strong></span>
            <p>
                Atsuko Toko Fishretired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant, and is currently involved
                with various social innovative movements as a philanthropist. She is also a trustee of the
                Fish Family Foundation. In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese Disaster Relief
                Fund - Boston (JDRFB) with The Boston Foundation (TBF) and the Japan Society Boston (ISB)
                to support immediate and mid-term recovery in the affected regions of Tohoku. Atsuko
                visited Tohoku several times after the disaster to assessed and evaluated the needs of the
                people and community. In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised
                approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects
                working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB's $1 million
                grants were leveraged to have $6 million of economic impact.
